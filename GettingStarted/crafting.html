    <p>In Minecraft, to create items you need to craft them inside a crafting table,  one of the items you will need to obtain. To craft, there is a two by two grid inside the players inventory, this can be utilised to make the simplest of items, such as, the crafting table. Inside the crafting table however the grid is increased to a size of three by three gaining the ability to craft more items.</p>
    <h2>Shapeless Recipes</h2>
    <p>Some recipes inside the crafting table do not require their ingredients to be arranged in a specific way. These are known as shapeless recipes. For example players are able to craft a fermented spider eye.</p>
    <h2>Shaped Recipes</h2>
    <p>On the other hand, there are recipes where the ingredients are required to be in a certain order, commonly called shaped recipes. These recipes are able to be moved in any sort of way, up, down, left, right, sideways or even flipped. For example, recipes such as bread or an axe.</p>
    <h2>Fixed recipes</h2>  
    <p>There are recipes that may not be moved or mirrored in this way. These are commonly known as fixed recipes. An example of these types of recipes are dyes in banner recipes.</p>
      
    <p>Due to the massive amount of popularity of the game of minecraft there is a massive amount of items within the game, having crafting recipes for many of them. Many players are unable to remember all of them which is why there is a system within the game where when you interact with a crafting table there is a book icon, to which you tap and have access to all recipes in the game.</p>
