  <p>Minecraft has 5 main modes: Survival, Hardcore, Creative, Adventure and Spectator.</p>

    <h2>Survival Mode</h2>
    <p>In Survival, players start with no items in a fresh world. They can farm, build, explore, and befriend, limited only by their imagination and resources. The game is officially beaten when the ender dragon is defeated. Survival has four difficulty levels: One being Peaceful where no hostile mobs spawn, the hunger bar never depletes, and health regenerates quickly. Easy where hostile mobs spawn without inflicting harmful status effects. They also deal half the damage of normal mode, and hunger only depletes to 5 hearts, preventing death by starvation. Normal is when mobs deal standard damage and inflict effects. Hunger depletes to 0.5 hearts, but players can't die from starvation. In Hard, mobs deal more damage and inflict harmful effects. Hunger depletes fully, leading to death if players don't eat.
    
    <h2>Hardcore Mode</h2>
    <p>Hardcore is known for its brutal difficulty as players can't respawn. Once you die, all progress is lost, and the game is locked to hard mode. Upon death, instead of respawning, you can view your world in spectator mode before it is deleted. In multiplayer, dying results in a ban from the server.</p>
    
    <h2>Creative Mode</h2>
    <p>Creative is the easiest mode. Players can't take damage except from the void and cheat commands. There are no health or hunger bars, and blocks can be broken instantly, including bedrock. Players have access to infinite blocks and can fly. This mode is ideal for new players to learn controls and experiment with building.</p>
    
    <h2>Adventure Mode</h2>
    <p>Adventure is designed for player created maps with limited gameplay. Players can't place or destroy blocks but can interact with the environment, kill mobs, trade with villagers, and activate redstone mechanics. This mode is popular for minigames like parkour and puzzles.</p>
    
    <h2>Spectator Mode</h2>
    <p>Spectator mode allows players to observe the world invisibly without interacting with it. They can move through players and blocks and see through blocks when their head is inside one. Spectators are invisible to all entities except command blocks and mob spawners, making this mode useful for trolling friends or cheating.
