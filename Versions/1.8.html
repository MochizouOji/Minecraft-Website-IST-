    <h2>New Features:</h2>
    <p>One of Minecraft’s biggest updates is 1.8, otherwise known as “The Bountiful Update”, released on September 2,
      2014. It introduced numerous new features, blocks, and items that significantly impacted gameplay.
      Among the new blocks were prismarine, prismarine bricks, dark prismarine, and sea lanterns. These blocks could be
      found in the new ocean monument structures, along with common blocks such as granite, diorite, and andesite. These
      additions provided new decorative and building materials. The update also introduced slime blocks, which became a
      significant part of Redstone engineering by allowing the creation of complex machines.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
    <p>New mobs such as the Endermite and Guardians, brought fresh and sought challenges to the game. The Endermite could spawn when an Ender Pearl was used, while Guardians and Elder Guardians were found in the newly introduced ocean monuments. Additionally, the enchanting system was revamped to include lapis lazuli, making it more strategic. Furthermore, anvil mechanics were adjusted for repair costs and combining enchantments. The villager trading system was also changed, adding more trades. Spectator Mode was introduced, allowing players to observe the world without interacting with it, and new commands to command blocks were also added.
